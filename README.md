# Safe-Route-for-women-and-night-travelers-
SafeRoute shifts navigation from being purely location-based to safety-first, making it a digital travel companion that prioritizes protection over convenience. It’s particularly valuable for late-night commutes, solo travel, and unfamiliar routes.
SafeRoute – AI-Powered Safety Navigator (Mobile App)
Here are the some features of the above project:
1. Core safety navigation
2. Crowd-Sourced Safety Reporting
3. Offline Functionality
4. AI & Language Features
5. Women’s Travel Safety Features
   For creating the above project we used both frotend and backend
   in backend Online: Hosted Flask/Django API
              Offline: Integrated Python logic inside the app using something like Chaquopy (Android) or a local Dart/JS implementation.
   in frontend Frontend can be built with:
              Flutter (recommended — works for both Android & iOS)
              React Native
   This app helps the women safet while she travellling alone anywhere and it can be used through offline and online through live gps.
